							<p>Re-life Pharmaceuticals initiated its manufacturing activities in the year 1985 at
								rented premises in Gobardanga, a traditional place in the district of North 24
								parganas, West Bengal. Years after it secured permission from the State Drug
								Control Authority to manufacture Ayurvedic formulations, the unit, with the
								principal purpose of accommodating its need for expansion, was shifted to a nearby
								plot of land measuring more or less 8 kathas owned by its proprietor. A covered
								area of 5000 sq.ft was constructed on that plot to house the factory. go down and the
								administrative or office block.</p>

								<p>The unit maintains all the schedules of Ayurvedic Pharmacopoeia and
									Pharmacognosy to ensure which a well equipped laboratory is maintained. In order
									to ensure the optimum hygienic method of preparation as well as to avoid any form
									of contamination, semi automatic machineries are used in the factory. The unit
									presently manufactures liquid, tablets, capsules, churnas, oil and ointments. To
									ensure steady supply of quality raw materials and reducing dependence on the
									market, +essential medicinal plants and herbs are cultivated on own land or in the
									adjoining locations on contract farming basis.</p>
